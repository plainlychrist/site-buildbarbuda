# What is plainlychrist/site-buildbarbuda?

`site-buildbarbuda` is the website for BuildBarbuda.org. The website is a [Drupal 8](https://www.drupal.org/) content management system (CMS). CMS's, like `site-buildbarbuda`, allow many different people to edit the content on a website.

Since it fit the service mission of plainlychrist.org, the site started as a clone of plainlychrist.org and shared hosting resources.

# Design

This website shares the same structure as plainlychrist.org; at the launch of BuildBarbuda.org the plainlychrist.org website had not launched, but most of its hosting code was present. Both sites share a collaborative focus (plainlychrist.org for Christians; buildbarbuda.com for Barbudans) so the technical base (especially the choice of Drupal) makes sense.
