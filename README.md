# What is plainlychrist/site-web?

`site-web` is the website for PlainlyChrist.org. The website is a [Drupal 8](https://www.drupal.org/) content management system (CMS). CMS's, like `site-web`, allow many different people to edit the content on a website.

# Design Principles

The main design principle for PlainlyChrist.org is to be transparent.

* **Open-source**: All the logic (the code and configuration) is fully open-source, with a truly unrestrictive license (Apache v2.0). That means you don't have to pay anybody or sign contracts to examine what we are doing.
* **Open-data**: All the content (the text and the links) is fully open data. That means you don't have to pay anybody or sign contracts to see what information we use.
* **Reproducible**: Anybody with a modern computer can create a full copy of the existing website. That means if you dislike what PlainlyChrist.org is doing, you have the freedom to start your own I-Want-Something-Better-Than-PlainlyChrist.org.
